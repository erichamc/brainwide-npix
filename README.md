# brainwide-npix

Modules and notebooks for loading and using data from multiple simultaneous Neuropixels along with recovered anatomical data. Relies on output formats and folder structures from SpikeGLX (https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/), Kilosort (https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort) and Ecephys (https://github.com/jenniferColonell/ecephys_spike_sorting). Uses the Allen SDK for core anatomical functionality. Also uses some SpikeGLX utility functionality from the IBL.
